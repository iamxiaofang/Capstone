#  Captone project

## Project description

This is my front end web captone project.

1. On the client, I give the zipcode and date.
2. I use WeatherBit to get weather, GeoName to get place information such as lat,lon and city name.
3. Give the city name to Pixabay to get the image of the location.
4. Then I display the weather and image on the client using the DOM.

## Usage

- `npm run start` to start server.
- `npm run build-dev` to start client.
- `npm run test` to test.
